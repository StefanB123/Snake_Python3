# Snake_Python3
Create Snake with python3

You may use all the code of this project (Snake_Python3), but only if you state somewhere publicly viewable that this is my sourcecode, or you ask me personally if you can use it and for what.
The code may only be used for open source projects.

Following values you can savly change without a problem (new values > 0):
self.height; self.width; self.snake_h; self.snake_w; self.refresh_time

If you experience a problem you can ask me, i might be able to help you.
